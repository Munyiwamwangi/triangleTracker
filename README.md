\###Description
This app collects three sides of a triangle from user, and determines what type of a triangle can be formed

\#BDD
*The Triangle Tracker accepts three values in the three provided spaces.
*Once the values are entered, the triangle checks if all the fields have values and whether the values are greater than zero.
*In the case that one field is empty, or one value is zero, the an alert notifies the user that they have to fill all the three spaces with values greater than zero, and terminates functionality and resets the fields for a fresh start.
*Otherwise, the project goes on checking whether the given values can make a triangle as per the logic provided.
*In the case that the values can not form a triangle, the user is alerted correspondingly.
*Otherwise, the user is informed on the type of triangle that their values can form.
